"""Machine shop — one robot feeds five bar-fed lathes from a central rod rack.

The classic 1-to-many machine-tending pattern (no MiR-official case study;
composite of published bar-feeder replenishment deployments). A machine shop
runs five CNC lathes, each with a bar feeder holding a short magazine of
cylindrical rods. The feeders chew through stock at different rates — part
cycle times differ per lathe — and a single MiR shuttles rod bundles from the
central storage rack to whichever feeder is running lowest. The whole tension
of a 1-to-many cell is here: one robot, five consumers, and a day clock that
never stops for the robot.

What this exercises on the emulator:
  * GET/PUT /registers/{n} as machine-side telemetry: each bar feeder
    publishes its magazine level, the rack publishes remaining stock
  * lowest-stock-first dispatch — the priority decision lives in the shop's
    dispatcher, not the robot's FIFO queue (which only ever holds one job)
  * per-lathe X-MiR-Mission-Duration in *simulated* seconds — near lathes
    are a 1-minute (~30 m) run, the far wall 3 minutes (~90 m)
  * PUT /_emulator/clock at 60x: those realistic trips finish in 1-3 wall
    seconds while odometry, /statistics/distance, battery drain, and
    timestamps all come out shift-realistic. The clock is process-wide
    (every session on the emulator), so the script restores it on exit —
    but anything else running against the same process meanwhile will see
    time fly.
  * a rod-conservation ledger: rack out == magazines in, checked exactly at
    end of day, plus a zero-starvation assertion (no lathe ever waits on air)

Register map used here (pick your own on a real site):
  30-34  bar feeder magazine level, lathes L1-L5 (rods remaining)
  50     central rack stock (rods remaining)
