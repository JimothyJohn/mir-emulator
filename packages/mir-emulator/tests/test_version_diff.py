"""Runtime version-diff surface: the upgrade-preflight for integrators.

The load-bearing invariant is the converter oracle, made user-visible: the
pinned official 3.5.4 and the PDF-converted 3.5.6 must diff structurally
clean, or the endpoint would report the conversion pipeline's information
loss as API changes.
