"""Version parsing and the tracking-selection rule.

Rule: for every major release line that publishes REST API files, track the
latest patch of each of its newest N (default 4) minor lines. With the portal
publishing majors 2 and 3, that covers e.g. 3.8.x/3.7.x/3.6.x/3.5.x and
2.14.x/2.13.x/2.12.x/2.10.x — four API generations per large release.

Retention: once a minor line is tracked it is never rotated out by newer
minors — callers pass the already-tracked (major, minor) lines as
*keep_lines* and those stay selected forever, refreshed to their latest
published patch like every other line.
