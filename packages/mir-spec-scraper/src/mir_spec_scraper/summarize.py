"""Optional AI summaries for scrape PRs, via OpenRouter.

When OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY is set, the mechanical API changelog gets a
plain-English "release impact" section on top: what the new MiR version means
for integrators, in a few sentences. Strictly best-effort — any failure here
degrades to the mechanical report, never blocks a spec update.

The diff text originates from MiR's portal PDFs (semi-trusted input), so the
model is instructed to summarize only, the input is size-capped, and the
output is clearly labeled as AI-generated in the PR body.
